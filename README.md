# What_Time_Is_It_Mr_Wolf_Game
A modified version of the popular children's game "What Time Is It, Mr. Wolf?"

The game “What Time Is It, Mr. Wolf?” is a popular game played by children. One child, the “wolf”, stands at a fixed location. In our version, the wolf will always be at the origin, (0,0). The children are scattered around the wolf at their own (x,y) locations. The children ask “what time is it, big-bad wolf?” and the wolf states a time, for example, “3 o’clock”. The children then move 3 steps directly toward the wolf. If, instead, the wolf says “lunchtime!”, the wolf grabs the children closest to their location, and they are out of the game2. In our version of the game, we are adding an additional rule: children may never leave the first quadrant (so their x and y coordinates must always be strictly positive). Any child who leaves the first quadrant during the course of the game is cheating, and is removed even if the wolf cannot catch them. Any child who attempts to start the game outside of the first quadrant is not allowed to play that round.
